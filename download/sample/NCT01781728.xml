  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking to see if a certain dose of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) may be a viable treatment option for recurrent or residual pancreatic or
      periampullary adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No standard treatment option has yet been established for patients with recurrent or
      residual disease after definitive treatment of pancreatic or periampullary cancers
      (duodenal, ampullary, bile duct). Linac based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
      administered in 1-3 fractions has been shown to be an effective treatment option for
      patients with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, achieving local
      control rates of 84-92% at one year. Associated late gastrointestinal toxicity rates have
      been reported to be 22-25% at 1 year. We hypothesize that similarly excellent local control
      rates (80-90% at one year) with a reasonable rate of toxicity (&#8804;20%) can be achieved using
      Linac based SBRT delivered as 5 Gy x 5 for patients with local failure (remaining disease)
      after previous treatment with conventional chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with or without
      surgery and as 6.6 Gy x 5 for radiation-na&#239;ve patients with local failure (remaining
      disease) after previous treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy. The toxicities of note
      for this trial are grade 2 and greater gastritis, fistula, enteritis, ulcer, or any other
      grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity.
